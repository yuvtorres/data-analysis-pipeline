## Introduction

Have You heard about the Orson Welles's clasic: "1984"?  Perhaps You have heard about Big Brother, the almigthy state that can control all your movements and finally all your thoughts. This analisys is based in another idea takes from the book: **If you can control the words the people use, you can control what people thinks**. This analysis attemps to see if there are any trend in the words used by poets. 

The analysis will use a public database from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tgdivy/poetry-foundation-poems/data#PoetryFoundationData.csv), that contains all poems (13854) from the [Poetry Foundation Poems](https://www.poetryfoundation.org). The data is complemented by some statistics like:

- Quantity of lines
- Quantity of words
- Number of words used (non repeated)
- List of words used one time (for each poem)

In order to find trends, it is necessary to join some data-time related with each poem. The data decided is the date of born of the Poet 
- Date the Poet was born (from Wikipedia API, and some webscraping)

Also, its possible to make a general analysis of the words used by decade and see which are the most used words in each decade or what words have stopped being used.

## The Reports

The analysis by word is limited to words that have more than four characters.

## Conclusion
